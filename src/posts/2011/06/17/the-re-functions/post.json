    "summary": "I recently realized that of the core Clojure regex functions (re-pattern, re-matcher, re-matches, re-groups, re-find, re-seq) I was completely unaware of how re-matcher, re-matches, re-groups were supposed to be used. Their names hint that they are useful for something, but I had never needed to use them. To understand them, I first had to dive into the Javadoc a bit, more specifically the java.util.regex package."
